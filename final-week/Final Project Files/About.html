			<h2> Serivice Guarantee </h2>
			<p>
				I am a barber that is not perfect. I make flaws and I notice the mistakes that I make. However, I am also a barber that is dilligent and always doing whatever it takes to improve. I assure you that when I cut your hair, I am giving you my 100% effort and I'm always trying to do better than before.

			<h2>We Take Cards</h2>
			<p>
				We have updated our business to ensure that we can accomadate the payment methods of all of our clients. As a result, we are able to take card payments via the "Square Reader" application and swiper. Because we are charged a certain percentage per transaction, we also have a $1 fee for all card transactions.
